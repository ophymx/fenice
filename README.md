Fenice
======

A configuration management tool inspired by (and blatantly copied off)
[radmind](http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/radmind/).

## Why a new tool?
Radmind is awesome, why rewrite it? The radmind code is a solidly written set
of C executables but it's difficult to add features to, modify behaivor and
incorporate into other tools since it doesn't have a library to link against.
With this port to Vala it should be easier to experiment with new ideas in
radmind more quickly yet still maintane the speed that has made radmind nice to
work with.
